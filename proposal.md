## Project description
We hope to create a racing simulator game that involves both a hardware and software aspect
through utilization of graphics and programming in a pedal and steering wheel. Possible stretch
goals include random obstacle generation, audio implementation based on acceleration, and car
customization. A possible fallback position we might have to go back to is utilizing a keyboard
for controls.

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Yeabsera Afework - Responsible for most of the front-end graphics
Manuel Argueta - Responsible for implementation of the pedals
Marco Nunez - Responsibe for implementation of a steering wheel

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
We hope to have a working prototype of the game by lab next Wednesday with a keyboard
and basic graphics.

## Resources needed, issues

We will likely need to research I2C protocols in order to integrate a potentiometer
for the pedals as well as 3D print various parts of our project in lab64.
